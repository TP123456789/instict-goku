      Ultra Instinct[3][4][5] is an ultimate technique that separates the
      consciousness from the body, allowing it to move and fight independent of
      a martial artist's thoughts and emotions
    </p>
    <p>
      It is an extraordinarily difficult technique to master, even for the
      Hakaishin. However, angels like Whis appear to have mastered it.
    </p>
    <p>As a result, it is known as the "state of the gods"</p>
    <p>
      This technique uniquely manifests as a transformation in Son Gokū and is
      his most powerful form, transcending Super Saiyan Blue. Despite this,
      Beerus and the other gods recognize the transformation's completed form,
      hinting that it might not be completely unique to Gokū.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most users of Ultra Instinct, such as Whis, do not display a noticeable
      difference when using the technique.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Son Gokū and Moro adopt a unique transformation when using it.
      When the technique fully manifests, Gokū's eyes and hair become a
      distinctive silver coloration.
    </p>
    <p>
      His hair remains raised slightly and his aura remains crystalline—though,
      in addition to blues and whites, it now sports purple and red hues as well
      and is noticeably brighter.[
    </p>
    <p>
      In the manga, the Hakaishin Beerus notes that any god would recognize this
      form as the technique Ultra Instinct.
    </p>
    <p>Whis, who has completely mastered the technique, was able to fend off two Saiyan Beyond Gods with no trouble, handling them as if they were children</p>
    <p>Gokū achieved "perfect Ultra Instinct" (完全なる身勝手の極意, kanzen-naru Migatte no Goku'i; English TV "complete Ultra Instinct") by focusing completely on his fight with Jiren and building up heat within himself throughout the match</p>
  <p>He also abandoned the idea of allowing his emotions to rule over him, as they often did in his Super Saiyan transformations, and instead focused on making his heart calm and gentle. </p>
<p>Releasing the heat in a galaxy-like disc of energy, Gokū then absorbed it back within himself, allowing him to manifest the completed technique, which granted him a power that surpasses that of a Hakaishin</p></body>
